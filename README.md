# Data Science Programming – Final Team Project

This repository showcases a **complete, end-to-end data science project** completed as part of a graduate-level Data Science Programming course. The project demonstrates practical experience transforming raw data into actionable insights using Python.

The work emphasizes **real-world data handling, analytical reasoning, and clear communication**, not just model building.

## Project Objective

An e-commerce company provided anonymized online session data and asked for insights into **what drives user purchases**.

The goal of the assignment was to:

- Understand user behavior from raw session data  
- Identify patterns linked to successful transactions  
- Apply appropriate analytical and machine-learning techniques  
- Translate findings into insights that could inform business decisions

## What This Repository Contains

- A **fully documented Jupyter notebook** containing:
  - Data importing, cleaning, and preprocessing  
  - Feature engineering and transformation  
  - Exploratory data analysis and visualizations  
  - Correlation analysis and pattern discovery  
  - Predictive modeling and model evaluation  

The notebook is designed to be readable by both technical and non-technical audiences, with explanations provided alongside code and outputs.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset captures **online shopping session behavior** for an e-commerce platform. Each row represents a single user session and includes:

- Page views and time spent across different page types  
- Traffic source and visitor type (new vs. returning)  
- Temporal features such as month and seasonality  
- A binary outcome indicating whether a purchase occurred

## Key Takeaways

- **User engagement matters:** Sessions with higher engagement (more pages viewed and longer duration) were significantly more likely to result in a purchase.  
- **Returning visitors drive revenue:** Returning users generated the majority of transactions, highlighting the value of retention and repeat engagement.  
- **Strong seasonality exists:** Purchase behavior varies by month, with clear peaks during high-traffic retail periods.  
- **Not all traffic is equal:** Certain traffic sources contributed disproportionately to revenue, suggesting opportunities for marketing optimization.  
- **Behavioral signals outperform calendar events:** Engagement metrics were more predictive of purchases than proximity to special promotional days.
